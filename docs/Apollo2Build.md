# Quick-start guide

## Install grails

Installing grails is made easier by using [GVM](http://gvmtool.net/) which can automatically setup grails for you. We will use grails 2.4.4 for Web Apollo

1. curl -s get.gvmtool.net | bash
2. gvm install grails 2.4.4

## Get the code

To setup WebApollo, you can download the code from github:

- git clone https://github.com/GMOD/Apollo.git Apollo
- cd Apollo

Using a stable release tag might be suggested as well

## Basic configuration

Web Apollo 2.0 simplifies and expands options for the database setup. This section will cover the basic options for this.

The basic idea is to setup a new apollo-config.groovy file from some existing samples to initialize your database settings.

## Database options


#### Configure for H2:
- To use H2 for your database, simply copy sample-h2-apollo-config.groovy to apollo-config.groovy
- Note: H2 is a 'zero-configuration' or 'embedded' database, so it doesn't require any external database to be setup

#### Configure for PostgreSQL:
- Create a new database with postgres (i.e. via the command line `createdb apollo-production`)
- Copy sample-postgres-apollo-config.groovy to apollo-config.groovy

#### Configure for MySQL:
- Create a new MySQL database (i.e. run `create database apollo-production` in the mysql console)
- Copy sample-mysql-apollo-config.groovy to apollo-config.groovy

### Database schema

The database schema is automatically initialized when you startup Web Apollo


## Deploy the application

After you have setup your apollo-config.groovy file, we will build a WAR file to deploy.

```
    ./apollo deploy
```

This command will download and package jbrowse and other prerequisites into a WAR file in the "target/" subfolder. After it completes, you can then copy the WAR file to your webapps folder. If you name the file apollo.war in your webapps folder, then you can access your app at "http://localhost:8080/apollo".


Alternatively, you can also launch a temporary server automatically, which makes it useful for testing

```
    ./apollo run-local 8080
```

This temporary server will be accessible at "http://localhost:8080/apollo"


### Note on database settings

If you use the `apollo run-local` command, then the "development" section of the apollo-config.groovy is used, but if you use the WAR file generated by the `apollo deploy` command on your own webserver, then the "production" section of the apollo-config.groovy is used.


## Setting up the application

### Login to the web interface

After copying the WAR file, the webapp will be deployed, and you can access it at http://localhost:8080/apollo/ or similar (the path will match whatever you named the WAR file) and you will be prompted for login information

Figure 1. "Register First Admin User" screen allows you to create a new admin user.

Figure 2. Navigate to the "Organism tab" and select "Create new organism". Then enter the new information for your
organism. Importantly, the data directory refers to a directory that has been prepared with the JBrowse data loading
scripts from the command line. See the [data loading](Data_loading.md) section for details.
