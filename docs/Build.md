# Detailed build instructions


While the shortcut `apollo deploy` takes care of basic application deployment, understanding the full build process of
Web Apollo 2.0 can help you to optimize and improve your deployed instances.

To learn more about the architecture of webapollo, view the [architecture guide](Architecture.md) but the main idea here is to
learn how to use `apollo release` to construct a build that includes javascript minimization


## Pre-requisites for Javascript minimization

In addition to the system [pre-requisites](Prerequisites.md), the javascript compilation will use nodejs, which can be
installed from a package manager on many platforms.

### Install NodeJS

##### Debian/ubuntu

`sudo apt-get install nodejs`


##### CentOS/RedHat

`sudo yum install npm`

You may also need to install the `epel-release` package for this.

##### MacOSX/Homebrew

`brew install node`

### Install extra perl modules

The `apollo release` command also requires some extra Perl modules, namely Text::Markdown and DateTime:

`cpanm DateTime Text::Markdown`

## Performing the javascript minimization

To build a Web Apollo release with Javascript minimization, you can use the command

`apollo release`

This will compile JBrowse and Apollo javascript code into compact files so that the number of HTTP requests that the client needs to make are reduced.

In all other respects, `apollo release` is exactly the same as `apollo deploy` though.


## Performing active development

To perform active development of the codebase, use

```apollo debug```

This will launch a temporary instance of Web Apollo by running `grails run-app` and `ant devmode` at the same time, which means that any changes to the Java files will be picked up, allowing fast iteration.

If you modify the javascript files (i.e. the client directory), you can run `scripts/copy_client.sh` and these will be picked up on-the-fly too.


## Launching a temporary instance

A temporary tomcat server can be automatically launched without having you configure your own Tomcat server with the `apollo run-local` command:

`apollo run-local [8085]`

The port number is an optional argument.
